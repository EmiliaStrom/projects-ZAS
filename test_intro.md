## Introduction
Hello [*child's name*]!

Today, I have brought some stories with me, and I thought we could go through them together! Sometimes I will ask you questions about what happened! How does that sound?

In the stories, there will be lots of different animals!

[*Ask the child some of the following questions (or something similar) in order to get them used to talking*]

What is your favourite animal?; Do you like dogs?; Do you have any pets?; Have you ever seen an elephant?... [*child responds*].

Wow, great! Well we might see some of those animals later in our stories. 

Let's get started with the first story!
